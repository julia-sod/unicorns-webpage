          The unicorn is a legendary creature that has been described since
          antiquity as a beast with a single large, pointed, spiraling horn
          projecting from its forehead. ... In European folklore, the unicorn is
          often depicted as a white horse-like or goat-like animal with a long
          horn and cloven hooves (sometimes a goat's beard).
